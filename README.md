# Practice
Various Programming exercises in Rust and C

## What is this about ##
This repository holds a collection of various programming exercises that I am doing in order to get a better understanding of my target languages. I realized that I am not happy with my understanding of both Rust and C. So I decided to spend some time every day on implementing typical practice projects, such as Project Euler, Advent of Code, etc. 

Doing this in both languages will also allow me to compare both of them and see the differences between them.
